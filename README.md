# The Project Management Portal of Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology

This makes the process of managing and tracking projects much simple and easy. This also encourages the use of GitHub to leverage project tracking potentials without reinventing the wheel. Project Management Portal will be a one stop point, where faculties can be assigned and they can track the student's projects. The application follows a top-down role heirarchy structure to allow controlled access. This makes the application error prone and safe.

The Portal is divided into three parts,

1. Admin side
2. Faculty side
3. Student side

## Admin side
Admin side is the most powerful part of the application. This has the provisions to CRUD on every entity using a Single Login Credentials. The Admin side is built with completely Open-Source techstack and it's stable. The admin side also has a intuituve UI to handle complex tasks. Admin side is used to create next level hierarchic entities such as faculties. Usually handled by a tech-team.

## Faculty side
Faculty side contains a dashboard, where faculties can track and manage all the projects they are involved in. This also include abilities such as,

a) add a student to the portal
b) remove a student from a portal
c) edit project details and team
